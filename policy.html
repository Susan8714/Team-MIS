      <h2>Privacy and Data Security:</h2>
      All contacts stored in MIS Contact Hub are private and can only be
      accessed by you, unless you choose to share them. We use industry-standard
      encryption to protect your data and ensure your contacts are safe.
      Contacts are automatically synced across devices linked to your account to
      enhance your user experience.
      <h1>Permissions and Sharing:</h1>
      Contacts will never be shared with other users or third parties without
      your explicit consent. You can share specific contacts with other users
      within the platform by providing them permission or exporting data for
      external use.
      <h1>Data Usage:</h1>
      MIS Contact Hub uses contact data to help you organize and manage your
      address book efficiently. We may offer features like contact suggestions,
      autocompletion, and grouping to help you interact smoothly with your
      contacts. Your contact data will not be sold to third parties or
      advertisers.
      <h1>Data Retention and Deletion:</h1>
      Your contacts will remain in MIS Contact Hub until you choose to delete
      them. Deleted contacts are moved to the "Trash" and can be restored within
      30 days before permanent removal. If you delete your account, all
      associated contacts will be permanently deleted from our systems.
      <h1>Third-party Integrations:</h1>
      MIS Contact Hub may offer integration with third-party applications like
      email services or productivity tools, which require explicit user consent
      to access contacts. You can control the level of access third-party apps
      have to your contact data and revoke permissions at any time via the
      settings menu.
      <h1>Contact Management Features:</h1>
      Easily add, edit, or delete contacts at any time using our user-friendly
      interface. Bulk contact management options are available to streamline
      updates. Custom tagging and grouping features enable better organization.
      <h1>Compliance and Legal Obligations:</h1>
      MIS Contact Hub complies with applicable data protection regulations,
      including GDPR and CCPA, ensuring your data is handled with care. Users
      can request a copy of their data or delete it at any time through our
      platform's data management tools.
      <h1>User Control and Transparency:</h1>
      You have full control over your contact data at all times, including
      viewing, updating, and deleting individual or multiple contacts.
      Transparency is key, and we will notify you of any significant changes to
      our contact policy or platform features.
      <h1>Contact</h1>
      Support: If you have any concerns about your contacts or privacy, our
      support team is available to assist you through the Help section in the
      app.
